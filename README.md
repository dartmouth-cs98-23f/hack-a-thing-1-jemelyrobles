# Hack Technology / Project Attempted
  Attempting Eye Tracking

## What you built? 

I attempted to build a small eye tracking software. The goal was to use Computer Vision to use my computer webcam to track my eye movements and store the information of it. The overall goal opf this was to be able to then use that information for things like game play or even a simple selection using eye movements.

## Who Did What?

I worked by myself.

## What you learned

I learned that when using OpenCV for eyetracking, it can be really finicky. You have to cut out any opportunities for the code to fail, having to cut the face into parts to limit what can catch the eye tracker. I wanted to try this out to see how i could implement eye tracking in a game, but I learned that computer vision in this route doesn't seem very accurate or efficient. I think if i were to try again my next steps would be to look into camera to eye reflections and using that to track eye movement.

I went through and followed a tutorial by Stepan Filonov. https://medium.com/@stepanfilonov/tracking-your-eyes-with-python-3952e66194a6
and then continued to play around with and attempt to improve the method.
